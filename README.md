# KnowYourNeighbourhood
## The Scope and scenario of the application is
We had to build a Know Your Neighborhood application. The goal of this application is to provide login/sign up using an existing API, and a custom login API . For this to happen, the application should have login button with available APIs.

In the application the user should be able to perform following functions:
1. User will be able to login using provided API
2. User need to provide the existing username and password for that API and can login to the application.Customers can login using the existing API and fetch basic information such as name, email from API.

The Scope of the Project is to research of different existing APIs and compare for each of the API and evaluate their suitability while also identifying any potential security issues and build a login with selected API in existing website.

1. Home Page
